        | I have a Bachelor's degree in Physics from the University of Maryland, College Park. Since graduating, my interest has veered towards Computer Engineering and Computer Science. 
      p.about__p
        | Since 2020, I have been teaching myself the fundamentals of Computer Science: processor architecture, code compilation, communication protocols. Now, I aim to specialize in embedded systems software. 
        | In my free time, I build embedded projects, typically utilizing ARM processors from STM. 
        | I'm also interested in data science and web design. At my day job, I created a Python data pipeline for processing sensor data collected by a drone. I also coded this website using Express, SASS, PUG, and other tools!

        | My main focus is on embedded systems. I am currently coding my own mouse, with custom USB drivers written from scratch for an STM MCU.
        | Lastly, I'm keeping my web design (both front and back end) skills sharp by maintaining this website.
