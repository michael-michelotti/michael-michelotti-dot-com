    <h1>Current Projects</h1>
    <p>
    It is my intention to maintain about three Computer Engineering projects at any given time. The first project should utilize Python - a higher level broader scripting language. The jack of all trades, but the master of none. 
    </p>

    <p>
    The second project should utilize a more specialized language like C++ or Java to achieve a more specific goal. I'm guessing the goals will be the creation of some file parsing application, complete with .exes, .dlls, the whole works. 
    </p>

    <p>
    The third project will feature the lowest level of Computer Engineering possible. I want to attempt to create tech gadgets on PCBs or build robots logically controlled by Arduinos and Raspberry Pis, etc.. With this level, I want to learn about embedded software (firmware), microcontrollers, and all types of sensors and potentiometers. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Of course, I intend to slowly stand up this webiste, as well.

    <div>Project 1: Something Python
    Idea for my long term Python project: Write a script that pulls from some kind of financial services API every day. Feed the information into a machine learning model to predict stocks that will perform well on the basis of growing dividends over time.
    </div>

    <div>Project 2: Something C++
    Currently undecided on what my longer term C++ project will be. I'm thinking that I want to create an application that can parse .pcap files for a certain type of information.
    </div>

    <div>Project 2: Something C++
    My low level project, I think, will be building an OS. I might try to build one on my main computer and run it on my Raspberry pi, or run it on some kind of virtual box. Not sure.

      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
      I have a Bachelor's degree in Physics, but lately my interests have veered towards Computer Engineering and Computer Science.
