Code for my personal portfolio website. I am an Embedded Software Engineer, primarily working on ARM chips in the STM ecosystem. I also have an interest in web development, so I decided to build this portfolio myself using MongoDB, Express, Sass, and Pug. I followed the Model View Controller (MVC) architecture. The website features all of my coding-related projects, blog posts, and videos. 

The website is hosted live at [michaelmichelotti.com](michaelmichelotti.com).
